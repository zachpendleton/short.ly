# Short.ly

A(nother) URL shortener running on Sinatra. Why? Because I could.

## Stack info
Short.ly can be run anywhere, but supports Heroku out of the box. It
uses PostgreSQL for a persistent data store and Redis for caching. Could
I have used Redis for the whole thing? Yes. Should I have used Redis for
the whole thing? Probably. Why didn't I? Because in addition to showing
some of my coding prowess, this app displays beautifully my ability to
overcomplicate even the simplest app.
